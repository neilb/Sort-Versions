	* README, Versions.pm: Version 1.5.

2003-08-24 23:57  ed

	* mkdist: Changed to 'mkdist' written in Perl; now checks version
	numbers.

2003-08-24 23:43  ed

	* Makefile.PL: Removed DISTNAME - change to Perl standard
	convention of calling the package Sort-Versions-xxx.tar.gz.  Though
	I don't know quite what DISTNAME did.

2003-08-24 23:41  ed

	* Makefile.PL: Get the version number from Versions.pm rather than
	hardcoding it in Makefile.PL.

2003-08-24 23:37  ed

	* Versions.pm: Removed CVS log; I'm not that keen on it, especially
	as most of the log messages were empty.

2003-08-24 23:33  ed

	* t/versions.t: Use Test::More (based on patch from mwj99).

2003-08-24 23:25  ed

	* t/versions.t: Added some more test cases and commented the
	existing tests.  I think this partly follows a patch from mwj99.

2002-09-01 19:20  ed

	* README: Some revisions and modernizing prompted by Matt's new
	version (although I didn't incorporate all his changes).

2002-09-01 15:03  ed

	* Versions.pm: Updated my email address.

2002-03-09 18:19  ed

	* t/versions.t: Added some tests for calling versioncmp directly,
	if perl >= 5.6.

2002-03-09 18:19  ed

	* Versions.pm: Made versions() deprecated, so versioncmp() is the
	routine to call.  Small code tidying.

2002-03-09 17:38  ed

	* t/versions.t: Run each test in package main and package Foo.

2002-03-09 17:26  ed

	* Versions.pm, t/versions.t: Applied patch from Slaven Rezic to let
	versions() work when called from a package other than main.  But
	this is not the final answer, I intend to deprecate versions() and
	move the code into versioncmp(), which has saner argument passing
	(not the magic $a and $b).

2002-01-28 19:06  ed

	* Versions.pm: Version 1.3: patch from Hack Kampbjørn for '-' digit
	groupings as well as '.'.

2002-01-28 19:05  ed

	* README: Added some rather lame examples of -.

2002-01-28 19:03  ed

	* t/versions.t: Added some tests for - digit grouping.

2001-07-28 18:07  ed

	* t/versions.t: Whoops - got the leading-zero tests the wrong way
	round.

2001-07-28 18:07  ed

	* README: Whoops - got the leading-zero examples the wrong way
	round in the README.

2001-07-28 18:02  ed

2001-07-28 17:52  ed

2001-07-28 17:34  ed

	* t/versions.t: Added tests for leading-zero numeric comparisons.

2001-07-28 17:33  ed

	* Versions.pm: Added support for numeric comparisons where one
	version number has a leading zero.

2001-07-28 17:32  ed

	* README: Fixed spelling mistake.

2001-07-28 17:32  ed
