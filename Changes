	* Versions.pm:
	Made versions() deprecated, so versioncmp() is the routine to call.
	Small code tidying.

	* Versions.pm:
	Applied patch from Slaven Rezic to let versions() work when called
	from a package other than main.  But this is not the final answer,
	I intend to deprecate versions() and move the code into versioncmp(),
	which has saner argument passing (not the magic $a and $b).
