This module allows easy sorting (via comparisons) of mixed text and numeric
strings, similar to the complex "version numbers" that many revision control
packages and shared library systems use. For an explanation of the
algorithm, it's easiest to look at these examples:

  1.1   <  1.2
  1.1a  <  1.2
  1.1   <  1.1.1
  1.1   <  1.1a
  1.1.a <  1.1a
  1     <  a
  a     <  b
  1     <  2

  (special handling for leading zeros)
  0002  <  1
  1.06  <  1.5

To install, make sure you have perl 5.002 or higher, unpack, and say: 

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  
If the tests are successful, say as root:

  make install
  
And that's it. Further documentation is available in the Versions.pm file,
which may be accessed via 'perldoc Sort::Versions' after installation.
